"@marykorth1 @treavorbeaver I'm in San Francisco until Tuesday, but I'm free after that"
@treavorbeaver @marykorth1 are you guys free this next week? Should we do lunch with as many Prosper flute players as possible?
@treavorbeaver @marykorth1 lol maybe for nostalgia's sake. And so you guys can make fun of me for how rusty my flute playing is üòê
@treavorbeaver @marykorth1 plz no
@treavorbeaver @marykorth1 but I like your perspective more
@treavorbeaver @marykorth1 that's one way to look at it. Another is that I'm so disconnected I just use random words and hope it works
@marykorth1 @treavorbeaver we should have a flute section meetup
Shout out to @treavorbeaver and @marykorth1 y'all da real MVPs
Which kinda goes against the whole point of twitter to say whatever is on your mind
I'm the type of guy that will type a whole tweet  then stare at it for a few minutes then delete it because I question myself too much
I did it! Feels so good to set a goal and work hard and accomplish it üòÄüòÄüí™üëçüëç
Okay I'll make a goal. I'll tweet at least once a day for one day starting today
Man I never tweet lol. It's been over a year since I tweeted without replying to someone

Is your phone overheated? Dunk it in water and it'll never overheat again!
I'm ugly and I'm proud
I'm done with school after tomorrow
Currently experiencing the worst headache I've had in years #makeitstop
Finished the count of monte Cristo and my English project today. Didn't even cry once #proud
English sucks
"Getting pretty tired of reading the count of monte Cristo
That's what I get for falling behind I guess"
Something must be wrong with me. I love editing videos #englishproject
Sundays are great because I get to spend them with my dad
I can't stop watching breaking bad #someonemakemestop
Movie night with the best girl on the planet
I'm ready for school to be over now
Just rooted my phone
"Tbh, I'm sad Staar is over"
"Everyone needs to relax. If everyone bombed it, then You won't need many points to pass"
Studying for the ap test made the Staar look like kindergarten
There needs to be more time in the day
Nailed the Staar test today. Easy
Today is a sad day. My sister's old horse had to be put down
Flying by myself! #goinghome

I'm going to miss everyone from Prosper next year #toughestdecisionofmylife
It's so hard to say goodbye to a place I've grown up for most of my life
I don't have any followers so I can say whatever I want on here
Breaking bad is such a great show #cantstopwatching
I think I'm gonna go to Tams next year
I'm not sure if I'm excited to go to San Antonito or not
Now I see why no one goes to Walmart It's too crowded
I wish I could drive
